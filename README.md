# weather-app-dashboard
Homework 6
I have created a weather dashboard that allows the user to search any city and get real time weather updates. Along with this feature, the user can see the future 5 day forecast. The user is presented with the day, temperature, humidity, wund speed and UV index. In the search function the users recent searches will be saved. This is a fully functionable app that would be utilized often given that a user would want to know the weather and future forecasts.
